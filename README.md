# 🪪🚗 Driving And Vehicle License Department System (DVLD)
The main goal of this project was to learn and practice by building a system that simulates a real-world scenario, using **3-Tier Architecture** to organize the code (Presentation – Business – Data).

- **Presentation Layer** → Windows Forms (UI).  
- **Business Layer** → Business logic (rules, validations, workflows).  
- **Data Layer** → Database access (ADO.NET).
