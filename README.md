This project is a simulation system for managing driving and vehicle licenses.  
It was built for learning purposes and follows the **3-Tier Architecture** pattern: 

- **Presentation Layer** → Windows Forms (UI).  
- **Business Layer** → Business logic (rules, validations, workflows).  
- **Data Layer** → Database access (ADO.NET).
